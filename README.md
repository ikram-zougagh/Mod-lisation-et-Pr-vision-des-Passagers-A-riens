## **üìâ Modeling with ARIMA**
### **Introduction to ARIMA**
The <span style="color: #007bff;">ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)</span> model captures trends and seasonal patterns in time series data. It consists of three components:

- **AR**: Autoregressive term
- **I**: Integration term
- **MA**: Moving average term

### **Methodology**
1. **Baseline Model:** A persistence model was used as a reference.
2. **Component Identification:** Identified \( p \), \( d \), and \( q \) values using ACF and PACF.
3. **Model Estimation:** Used Grid Search for optimal orders.
4. **Validation and Predictions:** Displayed forecasts against actual data.

### **Results**
The best model identified was ARIMA(12, 1, 3) with an RMSE of **16.496**.
